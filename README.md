# To Do List App

A simple To Do List app for iOS written in Swift 1.2. This App was written for purely educational purposes. I created this app while
completing "Learn Swift: The Complete iOS Developer Course". I was able to do about 80% of app on my own but I had to follow along 
for some portions that I did not know how to do or simply forgot how to do.

Some concepts used were:
UITextFieldDelegate, UITableViewDelegate, Core Data, keyboard dismissal, swipe to delete items in a list, and more.
